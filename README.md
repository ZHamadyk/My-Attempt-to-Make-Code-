# My-Attempt-to-Make-Code-

Bear with me, I'm a novice, and I know this is sloppy as shiz. This is an attempt to analyze legislative text in the NJ Leg using NLTK, Collections, and Regex. The scraper not only needs work, but so far only works for NJ bills. The main interest is providing a tool that allows a user, someone ranging from a regular person to legislative analyst, to interact with legislative text to look for anything ranging from summarization, to using natural language processing and computation to provide collaborative and competitive legislative drafting and negotiation in legislative exchange between individiuals. 

This, along with other novice projects in legislative text analysis and text analysis of legal terms and conditions will reside here and grow. 

Can't wait to learn how wrong I did this so I can eventually look back and laugh.
